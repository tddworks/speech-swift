# ASR Inference Pipeline ([Qwen3-ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21337))

## Overview

```
Audio (16kHz) → [Preprocessing] → [Audio Encoding] → [Text Generation] → Transcription
                 ~5% time          ~20% time           ~75% time
```

## Stage 1: Preprocessing (AudioPreprocessing.swift)

Converts raw audio to a mel spectrogram `[128, T]` using Accelerate framework.

- STFT via `vDSP_fft_zrip` (in-place real FFT, zero-padded 400→512)
- Mel filterbank via `vDSP_mmul`, bin frequencies use padded FFT size (`k * fs / 512`)
- Log-mel via `vDSP_vclip` + `vvlog10f` (vForce vectorized)
- Hann window and FFT setup precomputed once in `init()`
- All temporary buffers preallocated outside the frame loop

## Stage 2: Audio Encoding (AudioEncoder.swift)

18-layer transformer with block attention over chunked mel features.

- Self-attention via `MLXFast.scaledDotProductAttention` (Metal kernel)
- Sinusoidal position embeddings cached by sequence length
- Block attention mask via MLXArray broadcast (`blockIds .== blockIds^T`)

## Stage 3: Text Generation (QuantizedTextDecoder.swift)

28-layer quantized Qwen3 decoder with GQA and RoPE.

- RoPE via `MLXFast.RoPE` (fused Metal kernel)
- GQA via `MLXFast.scaledDotProductAttention` (native GQA support, no manual tiling)
- Causal mask: `nil` for autoregressive steps (seqLen=1), broadcast for prefill
- **Prefill** (seqLen > 1): all prompt tokens in one forward pass
- **Decode** (seqLen = 1): SDPA uses optimized T_q=1 Metal kernel
- **Greedy fast path** (default options): decode loop is double-buffered via `MLX.asyncEval` — step N+1's forward pass is queued *before* step N's token syncs to CPU, so host-side EOS check and append overlap with GPU work. Bit-identical to the legacy loop (snapshot-tested); ~5 % faster on long-form audio (1.7B-8bit, 71 s clip)

## Decoder Options

`transcribe(audio:sampleRate:options:)` accepts a `Qwen3DecodingOptions`
struct that exposes the HuggingFace-style decoding knobs:

| Field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `maxTokens` | `448` | Cap on decoder output per chunk. |
| `language` | `nil` | Hint; `nil` → auto-detect. |
| `context` | `nil` | Prefix prepended to the decoder prompt. |
| `repetitionPenalty` | `1.0` | HF divisor; `1.1`–`1.3` typical. Positive logits divide, negative logits multiply — matches the HF sign-aware branch so the penalty always reduces the probability of the already-generated token. |
| `noRepeatNgramSize` | `0` | Masks tokens that would form a repeated n-gram of this size. `0` disables. |
| `temperature` | `0.0` | `0` = greedy (argmax). `> 0` = sample via Gumbel-max (`argmax(logits/T + Gumbel(0,1)) ~ softmax(logits/T)`). |

All defaults take the asyncEval greedy fast path described above; any
non-default option falls back to a per-token-sync loop because the
sampler pulls full logits to CPU and defeats the overlap. Output is
byte-identical to the legacy loop in either mode.

The canonical defence against "percent percent percent..." loops on silence
or ambiguous audio is `repetitionPenalty = 1.15`:

```swift
let text = model.transcribe(
    audio: samples,
    sampleRate: 16000,
    options: Qwen3DecodingOptions(repetitionPenalty: 1.15)
)
```

The legacy overload `transcribe(audio:sampleRate:language:maxTokens:context:)`
remains available and forwards into the new path with default options.

## Performance

| Model | Framework | RTF | 10s audio processed in |
|-------|-----------|-----|------------------------|
| Qwen3-ASR-0.6B (4-bit) | MLX Swift | ~0.06 | ~0.6s |
| Whisper-large-v3 | whisper.cpp (Q5_0) | ~0.10 | ~1.0s |
| Whisper-small | whisper.cpp (Q5_0) | ~0.04 | ~0.4s |

## Streaming / Partial Transcription

Qwen3-ASR operates in batch mode only. The entire audio input is processed in a single forward pass — there is no streaming or partial transcription support. The audio encoder uses block attention over the full mel spectrogram, and the text decoder generates tokens autoregressively conditioned on the complete encoder output.

For real-time transcription use cases where partial results are needed, consider chunking the audio externally and running separate inference passes on each chunk.

## Language Detection

The model automatically detects the spoken language from the audio content. No language hint or locale parameter is required. The text decoder emits a language token at the start of generation, followed by the transcribed text. Supported languages include English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and many European languages.
